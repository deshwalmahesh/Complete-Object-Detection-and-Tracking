# Complete-Object-Detection-and-Tracking
Object Detection, Object Tracking, Object Counting and more using old school CV algos, OpenCv algos and more advanced YOLOv4, YOLOv3

This code contains a merger of many different algorithms for detection, tracking and so. Covered Algorithms are:
1. Bounding Box Tracking using Median Flow Algorithm
2. Object Tracking using:
      1. BOOSTING
      2. MIL
      3. KCF
      4. TLD
      5. MEDIANFLOW
      6. GOTURN
      7. MOSSE
      8. CSRT
3. Object Detection and Tracking Using `HaarCascades`
4. Object Detection, Counting and Tracking using Background Separation Algorithm
5. Object Detection, Tracking and Counting using `ANY` deep learning models. I have used `Yolov4`

**NOTE**: Install `opencv-contrib` for the `5th` Deel Learnign based algorithms to work

**Future Work**: Application of  `EfficientDet` for precise (but slow) detections, `YOLOv4 + SORT` for precise Objection Tracking
